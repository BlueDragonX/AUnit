sentence=A unit testing framework for Arduino platforms inspired by ArduinoUnit.
paragraph=The unit tests run in the embedded controller, not in a simulator or emulator. It is almost a drop-in replacement of ArduinoUnit with 2 advantages. AUnit can reduce flash memory consumption by as much as 66% on the AVR platform. And it works with the ESP8266 platform, as well as the AVR and Teensy platforms.
